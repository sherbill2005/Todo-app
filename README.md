Here’s a sample `README.md` content for your React ToDo app with React Router and LocalStorage functionality:

# React Todo App

A simple React-based Todo application with the ability to add, delete, and persist todos using **LocalStorage**. The app also uses **React Router** for navigation between different pages, such as Home, Todos, Add Todo, and About.

## Features

- Add, view, and delete todos.
- Todos are stored in LocalStorage, so they persist across page reloads.
- Routing between different pages (Home, Todos, Add Todo, About) using **React Router**.
- Responsive design with Bootstrap.
- Navigation between pages with the `useNavigate` hook.

## Pages

1. **Home**: The landing page of the app.
2. **Todos**: View all the added todos.
3. **Add Todo**: A form to add new todos with a title and description.
4. **About**: Information about the app with navigation to Home using the `useNavigate` hook.

## Technologies Used

- **React**: Front-end framework.
- **React Router**: For routing between pages.
- **LocalStorage**: For persisting data across sessions.
- **Bootstrap**: For styling the application.
  
## Installation

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/react-todo-app.git
   ```
2. Navigate to the project folder:
   ```bash
   cd react-todo-app
   ```
3. Install the dependencies:
   ```bash
   npm install
   ```
4. Run the app:
   ```bash
   npm start
   ```

## Usage

- On the **Home** page, you’ll find the navigation links to other parts of the app.
- On the **Todos** page, you can view all the todos you’ve added. Each todo can be deleted by clicking the delete button.
- On the **Add Todo** page, you can fill out a form to add new todos.
- On the **About** page, you’ll find information about the app and a button that navigates back to the Home page.

## LocalStorage

The app utilizes LocalStorage to save the todos. This ensures that when the page is refreshed or the browser is closed and reopened, the todos remain saved.

## React Router

React Router is used to handle the navigation between different parts of the app:

- `useNavigate` is used in the About page for programmatically navigating back to the Home page.
- `<Routes>` and `<Route>` handle the mapping between different URL paths and components.

## How to Add Todos

1. Navigate to the **Add Todo** page.
2. Fill in the title and description for your todo item.
3. Click **Submit**. The new todo will be added to the list.

## How to Delete Todos

1. Go to the **Todos** page.
2. Click the **Delete** button next to the todo you want to remove.
